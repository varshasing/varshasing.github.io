      <h2>Speech to Emotion Recognition</h2>
      <p>Using a deep learning architecture to identify the underlying emootion given some English speaking audio, formally known as Speech to Emotion Recognition (SER). Our model differentiates between anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutrality. We set a baseline model to base our improvements against, as a CNN. We tried a variety of architectures with a CNN with GRU, CNN-Transformer, ResNet, Mamba, and hybrid Mamba-CNN model. Our Mamba-CNN model performed best with an improvement of of 1.29% As compared to the base CNN.</p>

      <p>Linux kernel module that controls a model traffic light via the BeagleBone Black's GPIO pins: some pins are programmed as input (reading from buttons) and some others are as outputs (controlling LEDs). The pins are controlled entirely from kernelspace, there is no userspace component in this project. We have 3 operational modes (as well as a pedestrian call button and pedestrian mode), as well as a readable and writable character device for viewing information about the current status, and writing to change the current cycle rate. Finaly, we added a "lightbulb check", which lights up all three traffic lights as long as both buttons are held down simultaneously.</p>

      <h2>Jailbreaking Large Language Models</h2>
      <p>Assessed the scope and severity of jailbreaking in commonly-used models and propose a practical workflow to support safer interactions with LLMs. We began by conducting comparative analysis of jailbreak vulnerabilities across several leading chatbot platforms, evaluating their susceptability to prompt-based attacks. We quantified the success rate of attempts and categorized the types of content or actions that emerge from the exploits attempted through PAIR. We then developed a modular defense framework that integrates prompt validaition and response filtering to reduce the likelihoood of unsafe outputs with feedback loops and continuous monitoring.</p>

      <h2>Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency Decoder</h2>
      <p>Matlab study in Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) as used in phone dialing, and is usd worldwide for telephone signaling to the call switching center in the voice frequency band. When the input to a filter bank is a DTMF signal, the output from two of the bandpass filters should be large and the rest should be small. If two outputs are large, then it is understood to be the corresponding frequencies. This project has two sections. The first focuses on generating telephone keypad tones, analyzing telephone keypad tones with the Fourier Transform, and designing a telephone keypad decoder. The second section analyzes and designs a simple bandpass filter to be used in the filter bank of a DTMF decoder, and creates and tests a complete DTMF decoding system.</p>

      <h2>Limited Dexterity Smart Desk Lamp</h2>
      <p>The goal of this desk lamp is to provide users with mobility constraints an accessible, functional lamp that provides a full spectrum of visible lighting. The lamp requires no applied force. The device utiliizes an RTC module, 10W RGB, and a dual proximity and ambient light sensor. An Arduino UNO microcontroller drives the logic for our smart lamp. We housed our hardware in a 3D printed cylinder with an attached gooseneck, a laser-printed support, and a lampshade. Ultimately, we created a working prototype and reduced manufacturing costs by over <strong>~50%</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Reinforcement Learning-based Blackjack Agent</h2>
      <p>Tasked to build a Blackjack agent with reinforcement learning to achieve as close to published win rates as possible. I built a testing environment for my Blackjack agent in Python, created a state for the model to learn from (knowing the value of cards it and the dealer drew, as well as the number of hard and soft aces in each hand). Implementing a Q-learning algorithm, I was able to observe win rate over ten-thousand simulations of Blackjack, fine-tune the reward structure, and analyze performance metrics. With this, I achieved a <strong>~42.1%</strong> win rate, right on-par with published papers.</p>
